# store-manager
The goal of this project is to get a primitive store-control program up and running using OOP.
The project is a part of our curriculum, and if done well, might win us a cup and some bragging rights!


Development has been split in two main stages:

1. Get a "Terminal-type" application working.
2. Use the existing code to try and turn it into a game.
